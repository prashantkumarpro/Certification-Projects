        <h3>Here are some Bill Gates quotes on life, success, wisdom</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Don’t compare yourself with anyone in this world…if you do so, you are insulting yourself.
          </li>
          <li>If you are born poor it’s not your mistake, but if you die poor it’s your mistake.</li>
          <li> Life is not fair, get used to it!</li>

          <li>It’s fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.</li>

          <li>As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others.</li>

          <li> I believe that if you show people the problems and you show them the solutions they will be

          <li>Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.</li>
